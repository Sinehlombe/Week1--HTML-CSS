# Week1--HTML-CSS
HTML- HyperText Markup Lannguage
    - declarative language -instructions are declared. 
    - simple, resilient and robust - incorrect syntax can be fixed and have the program running. 

CSS - Cascading Style Sheet
    - For styling. Your fonts, colour, animations etc. 
    - an error in css code can be skipped, the next part is executed. The browser produces the best possible outcome from the executed instructions.   
Javascript - more advanved in terms of capabilities in reference with  HTML and CSS.  
           - enables you to create a more interactive stuff.  
           - unlike HTML and CSS it has no way to cater for errors, any error in code or oudated browser of a code it doesnt understand, it just does not execute the code, doesnt even try. Its said to be fraigile                 - because of this.  

  TEXT FORMATING
  HTML Syntax - used to structure web pages. 
              - it uses tags- are enclosed by  <> signs i.e <p> .  
              - there are two types of tags - opening tags and closing tags. 
              - the opening tag for a paragraph is <p>, and the closing tag is </p>. 
              - enclosed between the tags is an element. It is the content insde. 

              - Some elements require both an opening and a closing tag, while others do not. 
              - spme elements can be nested.  

              - an entire HTML document is basically a bunch of HTML elements nested inside each other. 
              - The browser  builds a big family tree that shows how everything is related, this is called a DOM tree - Document Object Model. 
              - The browser uses the DOM tree to create an accessibility tree. 
                    - Your choice of HTML elements actually impacts the user experience on your website, including people with various disabilities. It all starts with nesting those HTML elements.
        Paragraphs: HTML tags are used to indicate the paragraphs. <p> as an opening tag and </p> as a closing tag. This tells the browser that it is a separate paragraph. 

  HTML HEADLINES
  -The HTML elements used for marking up headlines come in six different types: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6.
      -the heirachy gives an indication on how the browser presents it: h1 being the largest and boldest and h6 being the smallest and lest\ast attention grabbing.
      
HTML BOLD and ITALICS
      -There are four HTML elements related to this, two for bold and two for italic.
         - ITALICS
          -use the "<i>" element to apply visual italics and the "<em>" element to add emphasis. 
              - they look the same but serve different purposes. It is about communicating semantics and human meaning. 
        - BOLD
            - "<strong>" to highlight a specific part of a phrase as more significant than the rest. 
            - f we want to make certain words bold without conveying any meaning, we can use the "<b>" element. This is useful when we want a specific phrase to catch the reader's attention, but we do not want it                 to hold any special significance for the browser or screen reader. 

  HTML LISTS
     - 3 type of lists ; 1. nordered lists
                         2. ordered lists
                         3. Definition lists.
                         
              nordered lists
                - make use of <li>  tag. 
                    e.g. <li> flour</li>
                         <li> bones</li>
                when viewed on the browser it will be a list with bullets next to each item. 
                -the lists are enclosed between <ul> and </ul> tags. 
                    - no numerical order. 
                    - this gives an indication that this is an unordered list. 
                    
             ordered lists
                 -makes use of <li> tag. 
                    e.g  - <li> flour</li>
                         -<li> bones</li>
                      -the lists are enclosed between <ol> and </ol> tags. 
                      this <ol> indicates that this is an orderd list and on the browser a list with numbers will show. 
                         e.g 1. flour
                             2. bones
                             
            - Unordered and ordered lists are quite similar, except for the wrapping element they use.

              definition list/description list
                - tags used: <dt> definition term  - 
                             <dd> definition description
                               - can be used multiple times if you want multiple descrptions.  
                             <dl> definition list - The entire list is wrapped in a <dl>
                          Interestingly, the <dd>  and  <td> tags are placed side by side without any additional wrapper around them. This is simply how a definition list is structured. 
              - HTML Quotes
              
                      two elements:  
                      <cite> and <blockquote>  
                        serve a semantic purpose.   
                        <blockquote> 
                        <p> TEXT </P>
                        <cite> -Jeremy Z
                        </blockquote>

                    inline quotes
                    <strong>, <b>, <I>, and <em>, are called "inline" because they are meant to wrap around phrases of text that are inline with other content. 
                    <q> ued for quote. 

              -block-level elements, like block quotes, paragraphs, and unordered lists.

            Date elements 

            HTML Date and Time Inputs
              - uses <time> elements. 
              -
